Overview

This is a HTML5 game designed to teach computational thinking skills to elementary-aged children.  In the game the player takes the role of a "Princess Knight" who must learn how to control Dragons.  The Dragon in the game can only be controlled through the use of "spells" placed by the player.  These spells represent very small instructions - they are only useful when combined together.  Progressing through the game will unlock progressively more complicated and powerful spells which will enable the player's Dragon to navigate increasingly sophisticated environments.

Age Range

The game is designed for 5-7 year olds.  Some of the later levels may challenge younger children in that age range.

Supported Browsers

The game requires a HTML5 capable browser.  The latest versions of Chrome and Firefox both have been tested to work with this game.

Install

This game does not make use of any server-side scripting, thus it does not need to be installed into a web server in order to run.  Simply opening index.html in a compatible browser will work.

The game does require the google closure library to be downloaded locally.  This can be done by executing the "GetClosureLib" file - which will download the required code from google's servers.  Note this uses svn to get the files - if you do not have a svn client installed locally you will need to get one.
